| | |
|---|---|
| **Data source** | PVGIS ERA5, European Commission Joint Research Centre |
| **Coverage** | 33 districts across Nepal's Terai, Hill, and Mountain solar resource zones |
| **Period** | 2005 to 2023 |
| **Variable** | Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) |

## Key Finding

Nepal's annual solar resource is not stable. All 33 districts show
significant year-on-year variability across the 2005-2023 period.

The most important pattern is a sustained low-resource trough that
ran from roughly 2015 to 2021. During that period, most Terai and
Hill zones fell 8-13% below their 2005 baseline and stayed there.
Not for a single year. For approximately six consecutive years. The
resource recovered toward 2005 levels by 2022-2023.

The net change from 2005 to 2023 averages -1.4% across all 33
districts. Seven districts show a net gain. Twenty-six show a net
decline. The range is +2.5% (Jhapa, Eastern Terai) to -3.8% (Dolpa,
High Mountain). But the six-year trough is what matters for project
financing, not the 19-year average.

A project financed in 2010 using 2005-2010 historical GHI averages
as the yield basis would have received 8-13% less generation than
assumed every year from 2015 to 2021. Standard P50 yield estimates
do not model sustained multi-year resource troughs. This analysis
documents that such a trough happened.

## Methodology

- **API:** PVGIS v5.3 MRcalc endpoint
- **Database:** PVGIS-ERA5 (ECMWF reanalysis)
- **Parameters:** `horirrad=1` (GHI), `mr_dni=1` (DNI)
- **Spatial resolution:** ERA5 (~25 km grid). District centroids used as query points.
- **Temporal:** Monthly totals aggregated to annual totals per year.
- **Trend method:** Two approaches used together. First, endpoint comparison:
  percentage change from 2005 to 2023. Second, linear regression (OLS) slope
  over the full 19-year period, shown as dashed lines in Chart 2. Using both
  avoids the endpoint sensitivity problem of the comparison method alone.
- **Variability metric:** Coefficient of variation (CoV) = standard deviation
  divided by mean, expressed as a percentage over the 19-year period per district.
